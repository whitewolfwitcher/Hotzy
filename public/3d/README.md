## How to Export from Blender

1. Open your `Mug_AR_Rebuild.blend1` file in Blender
2. Go to: **File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)**
3. Choose **GLB format** (single binary file)
4. Save as: `Mug_AR_Rebuild.glb`
5. Copy the file to this directory: `public/3d/Mug_AR_Rebuild.glb`

## File Location
